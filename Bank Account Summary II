# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Users.name, SUM(Transactions.amount) AS 'Balance'
FROM Users
LEFT JOIN Transactions on Users.account = Transactions.account
GROUP BY Users.name
HAVING SUM(Transactions.amount) > 10000

# Second solution 
with tmp as(
select t.account, u.name, sum(amount) as balance
from Transactions t
left join Users u on t.account = u.account
group by account )

select name, balance
from tmp
where balance > 10000
